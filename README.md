# Perceptron project

The script implements a Perceptron learning to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The MNIST database of handwritten digits (from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is used. The dataset has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
